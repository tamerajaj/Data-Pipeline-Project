# Data Pipeline Project

In this project you are going to build a data pipeline that is processing the `Green Taxi Trips` of the NYC Taxi Trip Dataset. 

1. You should write a script that is directly uploading the data of the first 3 months of the year 2021 to a GCS bucket.
2. You should write a script that is processing the data and calculating the revenue per day and taxi type. The result should be saved as a parquet file in a GCS bucket. This can be done with Dataproc or Spark on a local machine.


Bonus task if you have the time:

1. Upload the data to an local SQL database or BigQuery and create dbt models that are calculating the revenue per day on it.

## Submission:

Please submit your solution as a link to a github repository. The repository should contain the scripts and a README.md file that is answering the questions above.
